; type the full tag paths of any tags you do not want renamed by deprotection.
; type one tag path per line. everything after the first semicolon(;) is ignored.
; line will be ignored if there is nothing before the semicolon(after stripping spaces).

; the exact code used to read this file is this:
; for line in file:
;     line = line.split(";")[0].strip().lower().replace("/", "\\")
;     if line:
;         tag_paths_to_not_overwrite.add(line)
;
; these tag paths are already in reclaimer.hek.hardcoded_ce_tag_paths, so they can be
